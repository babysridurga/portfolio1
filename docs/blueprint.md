## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), chosen for its association with creativity and sophistication, creating a professional yet modern feel. It also ensures good contrast against the light and dark schemes.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) in light mode, and dark grey (#333333) in dark mode, both hues being desaturated violets that subtly align with the primary color without distracting from it.
- Accent color: Blue (#2196F3), used to highlight key interactive elements and links. It complements the purple primary color and provides a clear visual distinction.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. The pairing balances a tech-forward feel with readability.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Icons) for navigation and social links. These should be clear, recognizable, and adaptable to both light and dark themes.
- Design a fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox. Ensure each section adapts fluidly to different screen sizes, maintaining readability and visual appeal across devices.
- Apply subtle animations on scroll using the AOS library and Framer Motion for smooth transitions between sections. This adds a dynamic feel without overwhelming the user.
